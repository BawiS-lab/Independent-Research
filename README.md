# Vulnerability Detection Using ChatGPT

This repository contains the materials and resources for the research paper: **"The Effect of Code Complexity on ChatGPTâ€™s Vulnerability Detection Accuracy"**. The study investigates ChatGPT's ability to detect vulnerabilities in C and C++ code and examines the relationship between code complexity, lines of code (LOC), and detection accuracy.

## Overview
The research explores the following key questions:
1. **Is ChatGPT able to detect vulnerabilities in the code?**
2. **Does the vulnerability reported by ChatGPT match the recorded vulnerability in the dataset?**
3. **What is the relationship between source code LOC and ChatGPT's ability to detect vulnerabilities correctly?**
4. **What is the relationship between source code complexity and ChatGPT's ability to detect vulnerabilities correctly?**
